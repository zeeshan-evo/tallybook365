# Invoicing and quotation management solution for digital agencies.

### We use a more advanced version of this api with a lot more functionality, infrastructure and offer it as a SASS product for our clients. We used this as a MVP product to test out the market, currently we have 150+ agencies currently using our SASS service. If you are a freelancer or a small business owner you can deploy this to your own infrastructure and use this basic version free of charge if you want. 

### steps to run the api:

1. clone the repository
2. cd into the directory
3. run 'npm install'
4. create a .env file in the root and put your mongodb url, JWT secret and expiry time in the .env file in this format
   - MONGO_URL
   - JWT_SECRET
   - EXPIRY

Done! now try registering users and do your agency thing!


# * Basic frontend for this api is also on my github.
